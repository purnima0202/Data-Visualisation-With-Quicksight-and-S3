# AWS Deployment Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to the AWS App Deployment Guide, your comprehensive resource for building and managing a robust AWS environment. This guide is structured into four key sections, each delving into a crucial aspect of AWS infrastructure. This README provides a summary of the steps outlined in the [full article](https://medium.com/@kevinkiruri/deploy-a-web-application-on-aws-using-an-auto-scaling-group-bdec934c47e7), authored by [Kevin Kiruri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-kiruri/).

## Network – Amazon VPC

**Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC** is your network's foundation. In this section, you'll learn to craft a secure and isolated network environment. Key steps include:

- Creating a VPC: Establish the core networking framework.
- Configuring Subnets: Define public and private subnets for secure resource isolation.
- Networking Resources: Explore networking components like endpoints, DNS settings, and gateways.

## Compute – Amazon EC2

**Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2** is where your applications and services run. This section covers essential steps such as:

- Launching EC2 Instances: Set up web server instances for hosting your applications.
- Security Groups: Configure security measures to safeguard your resources.
- User Data Scripts: Customize your instances with scripts for specific tasks.
- Elastic Load Balancer (ELB): Distribute traffic and ensure high availability with ELB.
- Setting up an Auto-scaling group for the infrastructure

## Database – Amazon Aurora

In the **Amazon Aurora** section, you'll build a high-performance, scalable relational database. Key components include:

- Database Cluster Setup: Create your Aurora database cluster.
- Connectivity: Establish connections and security groups for your database.
- Data Security: Implement data protection mechanisms to secure your valuable information.
- Secrets Manager: Securely manage database credentials with AWS Secrets Manager.


## Clean Up Resources

Effective resource management is crucial. In the clean-up section, you'll discover how to terminate and delete resources you've created throughout this guide. This essential step ensures cost control and a tidy AWS environment.


## Conclusion

By following this guide, you'll gain a solid understanding of AWS infrastructure. Whether you're setting up a new environment, optimizing an existing one, or simply learning the ropes, this repository provides the knowledge and tools you need for secure, efficient, and scalable AWS infrastructure. Remember to follow best practices for security and cost management when working with AWS resources. Happy deploying!
